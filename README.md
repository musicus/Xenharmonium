# Notes
To use meantoneTemperament.pd the [pd-zexy](https://github.com/iem-projects/pd-zexy) library is required. You can install the library by selecting "Help" > "Find externals" and searching for "zexy." Choose the version that is right for your system–for example if you are using a Mac: zexy[v2.3.1]\(Darwin-amd64-32\)–click on that version, and the library will be added to your Pd application.
